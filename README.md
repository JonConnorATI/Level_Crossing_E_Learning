# E‑Learning App Development

## 📘 Project Overview
This project delivers a small but fully structured e‑learning web application. The goal is to demonstrate a disciplined, end‑to‑end development process—from early planning through design, testing, and post‑production—while keeping the scope manageable.

All work is organised into clear epics and tasks within Jira to ensure transparency, traceability, and predictable progress.
